# My Arts #


At first glance, science and art might seem like diametrically opposed fields. Science is concerned with objective truth, with understanding the laws of the natural world through observation and experimentation. Art, on the other hand, is often seen as subjective, concerned with individual expression and emotion. However, this simplistic view overlooks the many ways in which science and art are interconnected.

One way in which science and art intersect is in the act of observation. Both artists and scientists are keen observers of the world around them, using their senses to gather information about the world. In the case of artists, this observation might take the form of studying the way light falls on an object or the movement of a dancer's body. In the case of scientists, observation is the foundation of the scientific method

Drawings are a way of visually representing the natural world, allowing scientists to observe and record their observations in a way that words cannot fully express. Additionally, artists can use their drawings to visualize and express scientific concepts in a way that is both beautiful and informative.
