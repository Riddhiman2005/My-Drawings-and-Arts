By now, we have got to know that science science and the arts are closely intertwined, and many of history's greatest scientists have also been avid practitioners of various art forms. From drawings and paintings to music and dance, the arts have helped many scientists channel their creative energy and enhance their scientific discoveries. Cern has a separate department for it [https://arts.cern/].

Let's talk about  **Albert Einstein**, who is considered one of the most influential physicists of all time. Not only that,  Einstein was also a talented musician, who during his leisure played the violin and he believed that music helped him think more creatively and find solutions to scientific problems. In fact, he once said that "*If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician*."

Another scientist who was deeply influenced by the arts was **Marie Curie**.

She enjoyed painting and drawing in her free time. Curie believed that the arts helped her to relax and unwind, and that this helped her to focus better on her scientific work.

The list of scientists who also practiced the arts is long, from **Richard Feynman** and his love for playing the *bongo drums* to **Rosalind Franklin**, who was a talented *photographer*. 
Moreover, practicing the arts can help scientists to develop skills that are essential in their scientific work, such as observation, attention to detail, and visualization. For example, a scientist who has honed their drawing skills will be better able to visualize complex structures and systems, which can help them to design experiments and make new discoveries.

Practicing an art form can provide scientists with a creative outlet that allows them to relax and unwind, and this can help them to return to their scientific work with renewed energy and focus.

 



 I love creating arts/ drawings using graphs. It is a hobby that allows me to combine my interest of mathematics to create designs through the use of Desmos graphing Calculator.
